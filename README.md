The goal of iassetR is to interact with the [iAsset](https://iasset.nl/en/) api using R. 
Currently only reading from the iAsset API is possible. 
But we intend to expand the scope to writing data as well if this is somewhat securely possible.

This package is developed for use in case of [VespaWatch](https://vespawatch.be/), which uses iAsset under the umbrella of the [RIPARIAS](https://www.riparias.be/) project. 
Early in the development a wider use, beyond the even the limits of RIPARIAS, was envissioned resulting in a name change from vespawatchR to iassetR. 

The current version of the package should be usable by all users of iAsset however keep in mind it has only been tested for vespawatch use. 
When you encounter issues please raise an [issue](https://github.com/inbo/iassetR/issues/new).
